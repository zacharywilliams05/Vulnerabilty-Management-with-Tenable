![Zack](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d32b225-87b9-409e-83af-122c449ea81e) **Zack (Vulnerability Analyst):** Hey, good morning, Jimmy! How's everything been recently? I know everyone's been busy these last few weeks.

![Jimmy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/342408c8-2873-4fb3-ba99-ab70c5f1c352) **Jimmy (Server Team):** Good morning, Zack! Yeah, it's been a bit hectic, but we're hanging in there. Thanks for asking. I had a chance to read through the policy draft, and overall it makes sense. However, with our current staffing, we can't meet the aggressive remediation timelines, especially the 48-hour window for critical vulnerabilities.

![Zack](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d32b225-87b9-409e-83af-122c449ea81e) **Zack (Vulnerability Analyst):** I totally understand. It is a bit aggressive, especially to start. Perhaps we can extend the critical timeline to one week? It might be a good compromise for now, and we can reserve the 48-hour window for truly severe zero-day vulnerabilities.

![Jimmy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/342408c8-2873-4fb3-ba99-ab70c5f1c352) **Jimmy (Server Team):** That sounds reasonable. We appreciate the flexibility. Can we have a bit of leeway in the beginning as we work through getting used to the remediation and patching process, just for the first few months?

![Zack](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d32b225-87b9-409e-83af-122c449ea81e) **Zack (Vulnerability Analyst):** Absolutely. After the policy is finalized, we'll officially start the program, but we're planning to give all the departments about six months to adjust to the new process. Does that sound fair?

![Jimmy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/342408c8-2873-4fb3-ba99-ab70c5f1c352) **Jimmy (Server Team):** Thanks, Zack. We'll do our best. I appreciate you including us in the decision-making process; it really helps us feel like we're part of the solution.

![Zack](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d32b225-87b9-409e-83af-122c449ea81e) **Zack (Vulnerability Analyst):** Of course! We're all in this together. Thanks for working with us.

![Jimmy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/342408c8-2873-4fb3-ba99-ab70c5f1c352) **Jimmy (Server Team):** No problem! Thanks for the short meeting.

![Zack](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d32b225-87b9-409e-83af-122c449ea81e) **Zack (Vulnerability Analyst):** Yeah, those are my favorite types. Bye for now!

![Jimmy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/342408c8-2873-4fb3-ba99-ab70c5f1c352) **Jimmy (Server Team):** See you later!

**![Zack](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d32b225-87b9-409e-83af-122c449ea81e) Zack (Vulnerability Analyst):** Good morning!

**![Jimmy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/342408c8-2873-4fb3-ba99-ab70c5f1c352) Jimmy (Server Team):** Good morning, Zack! I heard you’re ready to conduct some scans.

**![Zack](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d32b225-87b9-409e-83af-122c449ea81e) Zack (Vulnerability Analyst):** Yep! Now that our vulnerability management policy is in place, I wanted to get started on conducting some scheduled credential scans of your environment.

**![Jimmy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/342408c8-2873-4fb3-ba99-ab70c5f1c352) Jimmy (Server Team):** Sounds good to me! What’s involved? How can we help?

**![Zack](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d32b225-87b9-409e-83af-122c449ea81e) Zack (Vulnerability Analyst):** We’re planning to schedule some weekly scans of the server infrastructure. We estimate it’ll take about 4 to 6 hours to scan all 200 assets. We’ll need you to provide us with some administrative credentials, which will allow the scan engine to remotely log into the targets to better assess them.

**![Jimmy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/342408c8-2873-4fb3-ba99-ab70c5f1c352) Jimmy (Server Team):** Whoa, whoa! Hold on there. What does scanning actually entail? I’m a bit worried about resource utilization. Also, you want admin credentials to all 200 machines? That doesn’t sound safe.

**![Zack](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d32b225-87b9-409e-83af-122c449ea81e) Zack (Vulnerability Analyst):** Those are valid concerns. The scan engine basically sends different traffic to the servers that will check for the existence of certain vulnerabilities. This includes looking into the registry and checking if certain out-of-date software is installed or if there are any insecure protocols or suites. That’s why credentials are required.

**![Jimmy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/342408c8-2873-4fb3-ba99-ab70c5f1c352) Jimmy (Server Team):** I see. Well, as long as it doesn’t bring the servers offline, I guess we should be okay.

**![Zack](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d32b225-87b9-409e-83af-122c449ea81e) Zack (Vulnerability Analyst):** Absolutely! Let’s just scan a single server for now and keep an eye on the resource utilization.

**![Jimmy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/342408c8-2873-4fb3-ba99-ab70c5f1c352) Jimmy (Server Team):** Not a bad idea. Great! Also, for the credentials, can you set up something in Active Directory for us? Like some Active Directory credentials? You can just leave them disabled until we’re ready to do the scan, and then enable them during the scan. After it’s finished, we can deprovision or at least disable that account—kind of like a just-in-time access situation.

**![Zack](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d32b225-87b9-409e-83af-122c449ea81e) Zack (Vulnerability Analyst):** That sounds good! I’ll ask Susan to get started on the automation for the account provisioning.

**![Jimmy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/342408c8-2873-4fb3-ba99-ab70c5f1c352) Jimmy (Server Team):** Awesome! Okay, talk soon.

### First Cycle Remediation Effort Summary

The remediation process reduced total vulnerabilities by 80%, from 30 to 6. Critical vulnerabilities were resolved by the second scan (100%), and high vulnerabilities dropped by 90%. Mediums were reduced by 76%. In an actual production environment, asset criticality would further guide future remediation efforts.

### On-going Vulnerability Management (Maintenance Mode)

After completing the initial remediation cycle, the vulnerability management program transitions into **Maintenance Mode**. This phase ensures that vulnerabilities continue to be managed proactively, keeping systems secure over time. Regular scans, continuous monitoring, and timely remediation are crucial components of this phase. (See [Finalized Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rvueLX_71pOR8ldN9zVW9r_zLzDQxVsnSUtNar8ftdg/edit?usp=drive_link) for scanning and remediation cadence requirements.)

Key activities in Maintenance Mode include:
- **Scheduled Vulnerability Scans**: Perform regular scans (e.g., weekly or monthly) to detect new vulnerabilities as systems evolve.
- **Patch Management**: Continuously apply security patches and updates, ensuring no critical vulnerabilities remain unpatched.
- **Remediation Follow-ups**: Address newly identified vulnerabilities promptly, prioritizing based on risk and impact.
- **Policy Review and Updates**: Periodically review the Vulnerability Management Policy to ensure it aligns with the latest security best practices and organizational needs.
- **Audit and Compliance**: Conduct internal audits to ensure compliance with the vulnerability management policy and external regulations.
- **Ongoing Communication with Stakeholders**: Maintain open communication with teams responsible for remediation, ensuring efficient coordination.

By maintaining an active vulnerability management process, organizations can stay ahead of emerging threats and ensure long-term security resilience.
